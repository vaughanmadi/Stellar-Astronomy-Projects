# Stellar-Astronomy-Projects
This repository shows my course projects completed using Python for my Stellar Astronomy class elective. In these projects, I used data from the ESA's Gaia mission to 
create CMDs of stars to identify star clusters, classifications, and to understand the ionization and physics behind internal stellar structure. This class was much more 
of a special interest for me, and satisfied a technical elective for my degree plan, but these projects taught me how to transfer my knowledge of Matlab-based data 
analysis and script writing to learn Python. These projects were incredibly fun, and I found that I picked up Python relatively quick.
